# Server
This is an example server repo. The code is in both C and C++.
`SIF` stands for `Server Implementation File`
`SIF` is located at `SIF/`
The `include` directory includes the `Server Header Files` 
The `program` directory includes the `Program Files`

To run the program compile the C and C++ code seperately. Compile the `server.c` and `main.c` into one file which will produce an executable. Compile the `server.cpp` and `main.cpp` into one file which will produce an executable.

For the C code run:
````
g++ server.c main.c -o my_server
````
For the C++ code run:
````
g++ server.cpp main.cpp -o my_server
````
